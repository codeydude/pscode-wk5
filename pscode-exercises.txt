// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Enter a number
Is the number divisible by 2?
If yes, the number is even
If no, the number is odd


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Enter 5 numbers randomly
Print smallest of the 5 numbers and mark it "smallest number"
Result = smallest number
Print largest of the 5 numbers and mark it "largest number"
Result = largest number
add all 5 numbers to receive a total number
Divide the total number by 5
The result of the division is the average of the 5 numbers
